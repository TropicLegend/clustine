# Roadmap

Ordering principle: get a distributed world working with trivial gameplay first, then add
vanilla mechanics on top of it.

| Milestone | Scope | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 Foundations** | Workspace skeleton, CI, architecture and decision records, parity matrix template, evaluation of reusable libraries, `botswarm` skeleton | Workspace builds and tests pass locally and in CI |
| **M1 Single-node walking skeleton** | Login, flat world, movement, placing and breaking blocks, chunk streaming through edge, world persisted in the Clustine format, single-binary mode | `botswarm` sessions (login, walk, place, break) pass against the single binary; world survives a restart |
| **M2 Two-worker cluster** | Coordinator with leases, static region assignment, player and entity handoff between workers | Bots walk across a worker boundary on a local Kubernetes cluster with no disconnects and no duplicated entities |
| **M3 Dynamic regions** | Merge and split, live migration, crash recovery from the log, fencing | Chaos tests killing workers lose no acknowledged state |
| **M4 Kubernetes** | Operator, Helm chart, autoscaling on tick time, drain on termination, metrics and tracing | Rolling update of all workers under bot load with no disconnects |
| **M5 Dense crowds** | Independent fan-out scaling, per-region time dilation, dynamic view distance | Benchmark with 1,000+ bots in one place published |
| **M6+ Vanilla parity** | Tiers T1–T5 of the [parity matrix](parity-matrix.md), worked on in parallel | Nightly differential tests against the vanilla server |
| **M7 Plugins** | WebAssembly plugin API, later the Bukkit bridge | Example plugins run unchanged on one and on many workers |

M6 can start once M3 has stabilised the simulation API; it does not wait for M4 and M5.
